## The decisions you make

I will go on about how I view the flow of a run in ITG. There is a mix of facts and opinions and how I currently view the game, so, of course, this is meant to be taken as an opinion piece from someone that played the game "a lot."

I don't plan on writing any suggestions on how to change the game in this article. I will do so somewhere else.

## The pre-game

On the first room opening of ITG you have specifically **one** observation you are required to make:

    What are the gates? How many enemies do I *need* to kill to get to the door?

You then look at where your card node is located and ponder if it's worth taking. If it costs 2 Trace I believe it is a mistake to open it at all. You then proceed to the gate.

All of that to say: **there are zero strategic decisions to make.** You will see three cards and open some gates. You are still not making any strategic long-term considerations past "add this card or nah" and you've already played for 5 minutes.

## How exploration plays out

You don't have to make decisions in the pre-game because you don't get punished for not doing it.

That is: **you are rewarded by delaying decisions** you make in terms of exploration until you absolutely have to decide. What dictates when you make these decisions is -- ultimately -- whether you will lose the game before making them or not.

Another way to put it: you draft cards because you lose if you don't.

### The graph of ITG

The graph of ITG is very unlike STS. It is way more open, which (in my opinion) might give the players too much freedom to optimize navigation in such a way as to trivialize content no matter how you slice it (I'll elaborate more in the next paragraphs).

In STS, every floor you climb directly increases the difficulty of the next encounter. This, in turn, makes adding cards to the deck to solve problems you have **now** a constant thing you care about. You'd love to not add cards to your deck and remove as many as possible just as much, but you can't because you're under threat of death _right now._

In contrast, in ITG you have increments of difficulty **under the player's control.** That means the player can figure out how strong they are, and if they think themselves able to beat encounters they can go ahead and grind all of them, all at the same difficulty level, and just blast through without any deck manipulation needed. Rinse and repeat until you feel like you need something else.

With rewards being accessible in an uncontrollable way, you basically put yourself in a pickle as the balance team:

* You can't know whether or not the player is strong enough to beat this content, so you can't make it harder;
* If the player found rewards before facing problems, you just trivialized decision making until the alarm rises again.

## Encounter balance

Encounters in ITG are very hard to balance, no matter how long you try, in my opinion. That's because of the alarm level increment being at the mercy of the player, leading to fights where you're either too strong or too weak. If you're too weak, it just means you will be leaking quite a bit of life until you add enough strength to your deck to then breeze through (until the alarm is raised again, rinse and repeat).

Even adding more encounter diversity might not solve it the intended way, in my opinion. Say you have some amount of encounters be beaten with your current config and the rest of them that might need some cards added to become easy.

If that's the case, then you are presented with two choices:

1. Not add anything and bleed life some amount of the time.
2. Add a few cards and be good for a while again; same problem as before, but you've added a few cards to the deck.

I'd prefer **2.** over **1.,** but **2.** only shifts the deckbuilding considerations from "what do I need to be able to beat combats in this alarm level" to "what do I need to be able to beat combats in the next alarm level".

In spirit, option **2.** is STS. However, STS makes it feel okay because you are **always** in this "just not good enough to stop thinking and just beat everything" until way later in the game. Meanwhile, in ITG, you have spikes of deckbuilding considerations followed by 4-8 encounters of the same difficulty level.

### Static enemy pool

The enemy pool being the same is obviously bad, everyone knows that. I just want to point out that adding more variety while not having separated pools for separated moments might just create an even more unfun experience in combat.

That's because if there is zero predictability in terms of "what problems am I trying to solve in deckbuilding" because of the fact that enemies are simply too diverse, then any decision becomes meaningless, as you have just a huge amount of possible enemies.

The best way to solve this, in my opinion, is to have different pools of enemies at different points in time **OR** space. Hear me out:

* STS already solves this problem with different pools in time. You're doing nothing new with having layers have different sorts of enemies that are all connected by some thread.
* STS does this with Acts and mini-bosses/enemies. In Act 2, you will see many more multi-attack enemies and bosses, while in Act 3 the mini-bosses are all about asking you to either burst fast, or be consistent in generating tons of block or damage turn-by-turn.

In ITG we have the option of having _zones_ of enemies, where each zone houses a specific pool of sentinels. Now the player can choose to build a deck that beats _this_ particular zone (because the loot there is appealing to them), at the cost of not having a good enough deck to beat _that_ zone.

### Card decompiling

Card exhaustion (as per STS nomenclature) is a good way of balancing:

* strong effects that you don't want to be used more than once (of course). This is the natural way to think about putting that keyword on a card.
* the big deck problem. I will take some time to explain what I mean by big deck _problem:_

When you have a big deck (20+ cards), you risk running more and more into the "this card is useless on this turn." That is, you don't have predictability of draws, leading to turns where you are extremely punished for drawing "the wrong half" of the deck for what the enemy is going to do now.

This is balanced by building a balanced deck and slowly removing starter cards (more accessible in STS than ITG). In STS, what ends up happening is that you have a lot of cards that exhaust during the natural flow of the fight (playing powers counts toward this!), and you end the fight with a manageable deck size.

Right now in ITG you are not incentivized to run a big deck. You are _also_ not incentivized to draft powers (protocols) just because of how overcosted they are for what they give. A protocol that gives 3 vim costing 2 is nonsensical when there are attacks that achieve the same rate while progressing the fight, and this effect is even more exacerbated by the fact that you naturally run small decks while drawing a lot, and thus can play the vim generator attacks once every one-and-a-half turns.

### Card design space

The design of cards in ITG are very similar to one another. We have too many cards that are "deal damage plus small benefit" while not having enough cards that are "mostly untangible benefits."
