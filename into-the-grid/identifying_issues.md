## Lack of decks

I believe the lack of cohesive, fun and rewarding archetypes/decks in ITG comes from a few different things:

### Quests are too easy

I'd like to first give a definition I'll be using for the rest of the article.

**Definition 1.** A _card_ is said to be **more of an enabler** the more it makes other cards more powerful.

**Definition 2.** A _card_ is said to be **more of a payoff card** the more it gets powerful as a consequence of earlier cards being played.

**Definition 3.** A _quest_ is a sequence of plays you have to make in order to generate a big enough payoff. A quest being too easy means you get a big enough payoff without needing to go out of your way in order to fulfill it. That is, you get rewarded for doing things you already want to do.

Of course this definition is hard to exactly set in stone, but I'll be operating under these definitions more or less.

**Examples** (TBD, I dont remember card names tbh)

**Problem:** Right now in ITG you don't have enough hard questions thrown at you in terms of "do I need more enablers or more payoffs?".

This is because your **commands** can fill in for your cards. Say you have a great card that just needs to be discarded. In that case, simply use the Darwin discard command, and you'll have it trigger almost always if you need it. You don't need to add a discard enabler to do it.

The same can be said for Ursa. Cards that care about your VIM are enabled by simply playing normally, which leads to a trivial _quest._

### Cards are too comparable

Comparing a card to another should, almost always, be very hard to do. To achieve this, you'd need enough design space and enough different payoffs.

### Cards do too much

By this I mean that, 


## Lack of threat of death

### Players chooses difficulty

### Enemies don't threaten decks differently
