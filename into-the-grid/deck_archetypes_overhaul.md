# Deck Archetypes Overhaul

## Existing Generic Archetypes

I want to start this article by highlighting what I believe is a "generic archetype" in the sense that both characters currently have it.

1. **Commands Matter:** Ursa has cards that care about having used Commands while Darwin has cards that care about having enhanced commands.

## Existing Ursa Archetypes

Right now I see these as the existing archetypes in Ursa:

1. **VIM Breakpoints:** Cards whose quest is getting to a big enough VIM to get a payoff.
2. **Grit/Feral:** I put these together because I see them as the same quest, that being start slow and after a few turns you get _swole af._ The quest here is "you will perform worse, until everything just feels way better."

Both of these archetypes are quite uninspiring, and most cards are either inside these archetypes or outside them, meaning there are no cards that "kinda" slot into Grit/Feral builds but can also be used by other archetypes well enough.

Both archetypes don't feel like they have a **quest** attached to it. The road to VIM Breakpoints is simply "playing the game," and even more so for Grit/Feral, where you never _arrive_ at a place, but moreso just happen to get there after playing the fights for a while.

## Existing Darwin Archetypes

Darwin has more archetypes than Ursa, those being:

1. **Discard:** Cards that gain some payoff when discarded. Some of them are enablers and payoffs at the same time, while some cards are only payoff, and uses the Discard Command as their enabler.
2. **Assist:** Assist is great at giving you a smaller deck, and it gets some equity by letting you defend when the enemy is attacking _next turn_ or dealing damage next turn when the enemy has barrier right now, which is great at letting you use your energy well. The downside is that you can also draw it in the opposite attack pattern as the enemy has.
3. **Augments:** You can pick an Augment card as an enabler where the payoff is simply having better commands and also pick Augment as an enabler for other cards that have a "cares about having augments" effect.

Discard is the most well rounded archetype in the game, in my opinion. The quest is easy to 

## A Philosophy for making new Archetypes

I would like to give more of a **quest vibe** to most Rares, while keeping Uncommons

### Making Cool Quests



### Where Commands fit in

Since you naturally raise your VIM through normal play, I would like to make it so Commands are mostly a way to slowly contribute to your quests.
