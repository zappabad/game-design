## The decisions you make

I will go on about how I view the flow of a run in ITG. There is a mix of facts and opinions and how I currently view the game, so, of course, this is meant to be taken as an opinion piece from someone that played the game "a lot."

I don't plan on writing any suggestions on how to change the game in this article. I will do so somewhere else.

### The pre-game

On the first room opening of ITG you have specifically **one** observation you are required to make:

    What are the gates? How many enemies do I **need** to kill to get to the door?

You then look at where your card node is located and ponder if it's worth taking. If it costs 2 Trace I believe it is a mistake to open it at all. You then proceed to the gate.

All of that to say: **there are zero decisions to make.** You will see one new card and open both gates. You are still not "playing the game" even after a few combats.

### How exploration plays out

You don't have to make decisions in the pre-game because you don't get punished for not doing it.

That is: **you are rewarded by delaying decisions** you make in terms of exploration until you absolutely have to decide. What dictates when you make these decisions is -- ultimately -- whether you will lose the game before making them or not.
