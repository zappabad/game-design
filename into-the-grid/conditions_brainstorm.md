# Conditions and Tokens

I want to design a small amount of conditions and "generic tokens" (cards like Burn, Void) that are reused throughout most heroes AND enemies.

It's important to have these be small as to not have a large lexicon that is hard to learn, while also making them interesting enough to enable a lot of "reusable designs."

The usefulness in these tokens comes from adding cards, buffs and debuffs that can shorten card text (and thus complexity) when jumping from character to character, enemy to enemy.

## Buffs



## Conditions

Right now, every condition has a "decays by one each turn." I think we should have conditions that naturally only last a turn, but it shouldn't be the norm. We should let a person keep the buffs they worked for through the rest of the fight.

Some conditions currently don't scale in effect, but only in duration. This is the case with Cached, for example.

I propose we create conditions that scale _mostly_ in effect only because that produces bigger numbers, which is the definition of fun. I'd rather have a single turn of gaining two additional VIM per card than having two turns of one additional VIM each. This way we also open up a whole new dimension of effects, where some effects prolong over time when played over each other while others stack their effects on a single turn only.

An example would be Cached being reworded to "Whenever you play a card this turn, generate 1 additional VIM". This way it stacks additively with itself.

Another example would be Feral and Grit not decaying per default. If you want something to decay it would be better to state it: "Gain 5 Feral. At the beginning of your turn, lose 1 Feral", while still being able to have cards that say "Gain 3 Feral. Decompile".
