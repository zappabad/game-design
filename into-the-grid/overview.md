## The decisions you make

I will go on about how I view the flow of a run in ITG. There is a mix of facts and opinions and how I currently view the game, so, of course, this is meant to be taken as an opinion piece from someone that played the game "a lot."

I don't plan on writing any suggestions on how to change the game in this article. I will do so somewhere else.

## The pre-game

On the first room opening of ITG you have specifically **one** observation you are required to make:

    What are the gates? How many enemies do I *need* to kill to get to the door?

You then look at where your card node is located and ponder if it's worth taking. If it costs 2 Trace I believe it is a mistake to open it at all. You then proceed to the gate.

All of that to say: **there are zero strategic decisions to make.** You will see three cards and open some gates. You are still not making any strategic long-term considerations past "add this card or nah" and you've already played for 5 minutes.

## How exploration plays out

You don't have to make decisions in the pre-game because you don't get punished for not doing it.

That is: **you are rewarded by delaying decisions** you make in terms of exploration until you absolutely have to decide. What dictates when you make these decisions is -- ultimately -- whether you will lose the game before making them or not.

### The graph of ITG

The graph of ITG is very unlike STS. It is way more open, which (in my opinion) might give the players too much freedom to optimize navigation in such a way as to trivialize content no matter how you slice it (I'll elaborate more in the next paragraphs).

In STS, every floor you climb directly increases the difficulty of the next encounter. This, in turn, makes adding cards to the deck to solve problems you have **now** be a constant thing. You'd love to not add cards to your deck and remove as many as possible just as much, but you can't because you're under threat of death right now.

In contrast, in ITG you have increments of difficulty **under the player's control.** That means the player can figure out how strong they are, and if they think themselves able to beat encounters they can go ahead and grind all of them, all at the same difficulty level, and just blast through without any deck manipulation needed. Rinse and repeat until you feel like you need something else.

In practice, ITG plays out like 

One thing that leads to this is what I'll discuss below.

## Encounter balance

Encounters in ITG are very hard to balance, no matter how long you try, in my opinion. That's because of the alarm level increment being at the mercy of the player, leading to fights where you're either too strong or too weak. If you're too weak, it just means you will be leaking quite a bit of life until you add enough strength to your deck to then breeze through (until the alarm is raised again, rinse and repeat).

Even adding more encounter diversity might not solve it the intended way, in my opinion. Say you have some amount of encounters be beaten with your current config and the rest of them that might need some cards added to become easy.

If that's the case, then you are presented with two choices:

1. Not add anything and bleed life some amount of the time.
2. Add a few cards and be good for a while again; same problem as before, but you've added a few cards to the deck.

I'd prefer **2.** over **1.,** but **2.** only shifts the deckbuilding considerations from "what do I need to be able to beat combats in this alarm level" to "what do I need to be able to beat combats in the next alarm level".


### Static enemy pool

### Card decompiling

10 starting cards has a lot of predictability. that goes out of the window as soon as you hit a single decompile or add a few cards. the issue is how fast it happens in ITG (it literally happens in the starting deck)
