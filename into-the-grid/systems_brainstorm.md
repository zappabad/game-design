# Design Philosophy

* Small pools with the same theme, connected to larger islands of "synergizes with".
* Glue cards are common rarity, they're versatile: can be at the center of the island or be a "boat" between islands.
* Uncommons are specialized cards or build-arounds. They're at the beach, not in the center.
* Rares are build-arounds too, but ones that often scale with how commited you are to an archetype. They never make or break it, but always complement an existing idea to its fullest potential.
